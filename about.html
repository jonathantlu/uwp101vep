                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a third year computer science student at UC Davis. A part of my studies is in computer networks and computer security. Side channel attacks are relevant to computer security, a topic I learned thoroughly over my coursework. I did not study this topic for my classes, but after learning of its existence, I became intrigued on the different types of side channel attacks that exist, how they are able to exploit the vulnerabilities of a computer, and how to prevent them. So I did my own research on this topic.</p>
                <p>I wrote this blog to expose this topic to more people and learn more about the different side channel attacks that exist. If you are somebody who deals with secret or sensitive information, these attacks could be relevant because they seem unconventional yet are very powerful: learning about them and how to mitigate them may be relevant if you want to protect your information. I hope that this blog reaches the people who deal with information or want to protect their secrets, as if somebody were to target you with these attacks you may be caught off guard.</p>
